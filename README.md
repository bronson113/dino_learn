Dino_learn  
==========
a hopefully fully self learning dinosaur game player.  
first project on machine learning.  
still working on actual learning stuff.    
if anyone wants to contribute to this project, feels free to submit pull requests.  

Usage
=====
still editing...

Currently finished
==================
* game api: get game field, dinosaur location, all obstacle location  
* simple hard coded rule: currently able to get to 4000 if lucky  

Still needs to be done  
======================
* speed up image processing: use cython or other libary to accelarate  
* create self learning ai to master the game: use tensorflow or neat-python
